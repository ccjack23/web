			<p>
				The June Rebellion is often forgotten in the eyes of most historians as it was unsuccessful.
				Progressive Parisians saw the inequality that exists among the poor.
				Louis Philippe's new reign may have brought the bourgeosie freedom, but the working class in Paris, along with rural farmers, were still struggling with food shortages, disease, and poverty.
				Three thousands rebels set up barricades in Paris the night of June 5, 1832. 
				However, the rebellion was crushed just the day after when ten times as many troops surrounded the rebels.
				The bourgeoisie was satisfied by the power they've gained in the July Revolution, and thus they did not support the rebels.
				Despite being mostly forgotten, the rebellion inspired Victor Hugo (right) to write arguably,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables">the greatest novel ever written</a>.

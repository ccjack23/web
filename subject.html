		<h2>Cause: Charles X</h2>
		<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_X">Charles X</a>
			was the French monarch succeeding Louis XVIII. He restored many conservative policies that catered to the "ultras", the French super-convervatives, and ignored the ideals popularized during the French Revolution just decades prior.
		</p>
		<h3>July Ordinance</h3>
		<p>Signed on the 26th of July, 1830, the July Ordinance suspended the freedom of the press, dissolved the Chamber of Deputies, and disenfranchised most of the French population.
			Although Charles X claimed that he followed the Charter of 1814, which was a constitution signed by Louis XVIII to guarantee people the same rights that enjoyed during the French Revolution,
			at the time Charles X was
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">never gonna give up</a>
			the primitive values that was only acceptable over 60 years ago.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			Charles X was forced to abdicate from the throne, and a
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Philippe_I">new king</a>
			took place. The upper-middle class regained their massive political power back, but the working and rural poors still had little money and no power as only land-owning men could vote.
			The July Revolution is often portrayed by the painting <i>Liberty Leading the People</i> by Eugène Delacroix, which shows people of various classes fighting for their freedom in the Revolution.

			However, the poor did not participate in the Revolution, nor did they get any benefit from it.
		</p>
		<h2>June Rebellion of 1832</h2>
		<p>
			The June Rebellion is often forgotten in the eyes of most historians as it was unsuccessful. Progressive Parisians saw the inequality in the poor that was left unsolved under Louis Philippe's new reign. 
			However, the rebellion was crushed in two days as the Bourgeoisie (except for bourgeois university students) was satisfied by the power they've gained in the July Revolution, and thus did not support the rebels.
			Despite being mostly forgotten, the rebellion inspired Victor Hugo to write, arguably,
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables">the greatest novel ever written</a>.

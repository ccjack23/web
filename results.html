				Charles X was forced to abdicate from the throne, and a
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Philippe_I">new king</a>
				took place. The upper-middle class regained their massive political power back, but the working and rural poors still had little money and no power as only land-owning men could vote.
				The July Revolution is often portrayed by the painting <i>Liberty Leading the People</i> by Eugène Delacroix, which shows people of various classes fighting for their freedom in the Revolution.
				However, the poor did not participate in the Revolution, nor did they get any benefit from it.

				On July 30, the liberal revolutionaries put up posters of
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Philippe_I">Louis Philippe</a>
				to stage him as the new king of France. And on August 2, Charles X abdicated, so Louis Philippe took the throne.
				The supporters of Louis Philippe are known as Orleanists for the House of Orleans, which was founded by the brother of king Louis XIV (that's 14, not to be confused with XVI, the guillotined one).
				However, there was still some legitimists claiming that Louis Philippe's reign is invalid even though he was of royal blood.

				The upper-middle class regained their massive political power back, but the working and rural poors still had little money and no power as only land-owning men could vote.
				Even though the new regime is much more liberal than the old, the freedoms that "liberalism" of the days granted only extended to the bourgeoisie.
				The working class was far too powerless to stand up for themselves when they already face the struggles of feeding themselves.
				As the middle class was satisfied with the new king, the working class remains ignored until
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848">the next revolution 18 years later.</a>
				The July Revolution is often portrayed by the painting <i>Liberty Leading the People</i> by Eugène Delacroix, which shows people of various classes fighting for their freedom in the Revolution.
				However, the painting is largely a glorification of the actual events. The poor did not participate in the Revolution, nor did they get any benefit from it.

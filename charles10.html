				Most historical events did not happen for just one reason;
				they usually occur as the result of an intricate web of people and things that precede it.
				The July Revolution, however, can be blamed on the actions of a single man.
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_X">Charles X</a>
				was the French monarch succeeding Louis XVIII.
				He restored many conservative policies that catered to the "ultras", the French super-convervatives,
				and ignored the ideals popularized during the French Revolution just decades prior.
				<br> <br>
				Charles X is the younger brother to the two previous Bourbon kings, Louis XVIII and Louis XVI (yes, the guillotined one).
				His older brother, Louis XVIII, reigned after Napoleon's exiles, and kept the liberal laws that were created during the French Revolution.
				He signed the Charter of 1814, which guaranteed religious freedom (while keeping Catholicism as national religion), freedom of the press, and more.
				But Charles X did not like the Charter at all, and he wanted to push for more conservative policies.

				Charles X's actions closely mirrors that of James II of England.
				James II was also the second ruler after a restoration.
				Before him ruled his brother, Charles II, who reigned after the chaos of the English Civil War.
				James II, like Charles X, disregarded the religious freedom that his brother respected.
				As a result, the English Parliament overthrew him and installed a new king, William of Orange.
				This revolution in England would be known as the Glorious Revolution, and it happened in 1688, almost 150 years before the July Revolution.
				The similarity between Charles X and James II is almost comical, and it makes a perfect demonstration of how malevolent monarchs can be so ignorant.
